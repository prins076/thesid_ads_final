../data/audios\6771960739432385798,"Okay, what's this whole impeachment thing about? In summer 2019, Trump straight up asked Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 elections by digging up dirt on his political rival, Joe Biden. Biden's son Hunter worked with a Ukrainian oil and gas company called Burisma. Trump was hoping that if Ukrainian President Zelensky said they were investigating Hunter, it would make his dad look bad, even if it was based on nothing. Even worse, Trump also purposely withheld $400 million in taxpayer money from Ukraine as a bargaining chip to force them to do his personal favor. This matters because Ukraine is fighting Russia and needs that military aid. When someone in the administration blew the whistle on him, Trump immediately released the aid and tried to cover it up. Exploiting the unique privileges of your role as president is called abuse of power. Trump also tried to obstruct the inquiry by deterring key witnesses from testifying, burying documents, and harassing witnesses who did testify. On Twitter, of course. So, the House impeached Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, making him only the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. But that doesn't mean he'll be removed from office. That power rests with the Senate, where it would take at least 20 Republicans voting with Democrats to remove Trump from office.

Like the third that says that you don't have to quarter soldiers, and the fourth that says the government can't come into your house without a warrant. These are saying that you have privacy in the home, implicitly. That's the reasoning for the amendments. So Griswold said that married couples have a right to privacy in their home, and they can't be denied contraceptives. And then in Einstein v. Barth, they said that if you only allow that to married couples, not unmarried people, that's discriminatory under the 14th. Then came Roe v.

I have an answer for this. So this graph comes from a survey, not an actual registry of crimes. So what they did is they sampled a smaller group of people and then extrapolated data based off of that. That's what they do on a lot of surveys, but they sampled seven times as many white people as black people. And that's to account for the disparity in population. But keep in mind, they're about five times as many white people as black people in this country. So it's still over-representing white people, but it's okay to do that, especially when you're looking for percentages. Which is what they were initially doing. But in addition to looking for percentages, what they did, and here's the mistake, is they use those proportions to extrapolate and get raw numbers. So they got whatever for these categories, they got they got answers for their sample size and then multiplied it by the proportions to get these raw numbers. That's an extreme misrepresentation of data and a statistical error. So this graph is super misleading. It also doesn't tell the whole story about how blacks are more likely to be wrongfully convicted and stuff like that, according to many other studies.",en

Beaches are filled with people and apparently these partiers had no idea there was a pandemic going on. But in Japan, there's only three times less people, but 150 times less coronavirus cases. This difference all comes down to two key reasons. First of all, Donald Trump didn't really take the coronavirus seriously until the past few weeks. Even when he was told to, Trump didn't wear a mask and that led a bunch of his followers to not wear them either, which caused a bunch of Trump supporters to get infected at his rally in Tulsa. Meanwhile in Japan, they clearly laid out from the beginning how to stay safe and people listen because they have a culture of respect and trust the government. This obedience comes from as early as their schooling where they thank their teacher after every class and even serve their classmates lunch. But in the U.S., we teach children the American dream, which tells people to not conform to society and build their own path.

../data/audios\6859840375125839110,"Hi, this is Things I Don't Understand. World debt. Don't get it. We made it. Why can't we just fix it? Like, that doesn't make sense to me. So this is an actual problem, but it's not so simple. The world has a debt of about $352 trillion. For normal debt, like you owing money to a friend, you either pay it back or file for bankruptcy. But for government, debt is more complicated. The U.S. government has $25 trillion in debt and every year they pay some of it off. But the problem is we spend more money than we make from taxes so the debt goes up. For example, in 2019, the U.S. made about $3.5 trillion from taxes, but it ended up spending about $4.5. So we added a trillion dollars in debt. That's spending from things like the military, which cost us $700 billion a year, or things like Medicaid, Social Security, and other things that add trillions more. So if we got rid of these things, we could slowly cut the debt, but a lot of people like and depend on these things. So another option is to increase taxes, but in 2017, Donald Trump lowered taxes, which is predicted to add over $2 trillion in debt. So the only other options are basically to either not pay anyone back or just to print tons of money, both of which aren't great ideas. So basically, we can fix the debt, but when everyone wants great benefits with no taxes, it's hard to do.",en

Oh no, I fully want to legalize weed, but I don't want to stop there. I want to decriminalize all drugs. You want to make all drugs legal? Now, there's a huge difference between decriminalization and legalization. If we decriminalize all drugs, then instead of being locked away for years just because of your drug addiction, you could be sent to a government-funded rehab facility where you could actually get over your drug addiction. Not to mention there wouldn't be any jail time on your record, so it'd be a lot easier to get a job once you've recovered from your addiction. Giving you a much better chance at success. This decriminalization is notably different than legalization, because when I say I want to legalize weed, I'm saying that there would be no consequence for getting caught with weed whatsoever. But, but if you just get sent to a cushy rehab program every time you do drugs, then what's going to stop you from doing more drugs? Drug addiction isn't a choice. A harsh sentence isn't going to prevent someone from doing drugs, hence the massive drug abuse problem we have in America. We can also look at other countries for precedent.

../data/audios\6876590038210170118,"This November, Maine voters won't be throwing away their votes if they decide to vote for a third party candidate, because they'll also be able to vote for Joe Biden or Donald Trump. Maine is going to be the first state to try Ranked Choice voting. In Ranked Choice voting, citizens rank the candidates on the ballot from most to least favorite. In order for a candidate to win, they need at least 50% of the vote, not just a higher percentage than the other candidates. In the event nobody gets 50% of the vote, the candidate with the fewest votes gets eliminated, and if that was your first choice, your vote now transfers over to the candidate you rank second. So for example, if you were a Democrat who didn't like Joe Biden but really didn't like Donald Trump, you could vote third party first and then rank Biden second and Trump third. This way, you're still voting for your favorite candidate, but you're not taking votes away from Biden, because he'll still get your vote if your first choice loses. I know it seems a little confusing, but it really is a big deal, because Ranked Choice voting can help loosen the two-party stranglehold on the US. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I think a lot of people are fed up with the two-party system.",en

Typically in places like Europe, housing is built into the infrastructure of the rest of the urban centers in the city, whereas in America, the urban centers are built together and the housing is built separately. Why? When housing is separate from the urban centers, cities become less accessible by foot, and When cities take up more land mass, it becomes less and less practical to build a public transportation system. So the responsibility of transportation falls to individuals. But why? Who benefits from this? The automobile industry and oil and gas companies benefit from this. But in cities built out like these, there is so much more that is accessible by walking distance, so exercise becomes a daily part of people's routine.

But when he started redistributing land from the wealthy white bourgeois class, they threw a fit and dipped to Miami. The US rang the socialism alarm and instituted embargoes that absolutely demolished their economy, and a lot of impoverished Cubans blamed Castro for their misfortune and left to Miami. Both these groups of immigrants now run, screaming from the C-word. A third group of immigrants are mad that the Democratic president at the time, JFK, funded a failed coup known as the Bay of Pigs. We are spiteful people, and my relatives that left during this period still cite that as the reason that they vote Republican. Also, as a deeply colonized country, Catholicism and the conservative politics that accompany it still haunt Cuban values. Also, also, American assimilation propaganda is so strong, these immigrants would gladly throw their own people under the bus just for a chance not to get hate crimes.

People who live in the city don't, they drive on the roads but they don't know what it takes to make that happen. They go to the grocery store but they don't understand what it takes to get food there. They buy a house but they don't know anybody who builds homes.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt had polio, and he was confined to a wheelchair. Woodrow Wilson was also put in a wheelchair after suffering strokes. Eisenhower suffered strokes and he also developed Crohn's disease while he was in office. Andrew Jackson entered office with two bullets lodged into his torso, and it was believed he suffered from undiagnosed mental illness. John F. Kennedy developed chronic back pain and an addiction to painkillers due to his Addison's disease. Warren G. Harding was put in a sanitarium 30 years before he became president.

../data/audios\6911173760242502917,"I have no idea how people take Charlie Kirk seriously. He recently tweeted, California closed indoor dining, mandated masks, set a statewide curfew, and closed outdoor dining. And he said, Florida lifted statewide restriction, no statewide mask mandate, no statewide curfew, and most restaurants and bars open. Then he asked, which state do you think has more hospitalizations and deaths? So if you want to think about this in the most simplistic way possible, yes, California has more deaths and hospitalizations. But he's not taking into account the fact that California has 39 million people. Florida has 21 million. That's 18 million less than California. So when it comes to COVID deaths, California has 24,000. Florida has 21,000. So yes, California has more, but if you take into account population, it's not even close.",en

I have nothing better to do all day than ruin some white lady from Kansas this day. Some lady the other day, I talked some shit to Donnie, and some lady the other day read my profile, says, Nimash Patel, and she said, go back to Iraq. Which in like 2002 would have been a decent insult, you know? But her profile is a white lady with a picture of her two-year-old son. Her profile says, conservative Christian mom.

This is the same woman whose favorite rapper alive, Tupac, died in the 90s. This is the same woman who grew up in an Indian household. Kente cloth pandering Kamala, stop lying. This is the same woman who said she listened to Snoop Dogg in college when Snoop Dogg wasn't even out yet. So it's not okay for people who look like this to use cultural appropriation. But when Democrats do it, it's fine. I need you to take a journey with me and just imagine if the Republican party came on stage with Kente cloths on. They would be cancelled forever. I've been black my whole life in America and I've known one person out of hundreds of black people that celebrated Kwanzaa.

Even if they lose, they'll still go have a beer with you. A Democrat, when they antagonize you, I'm talking about talk trash, make you want to kill them, and stand behind the police. The same police that they say they want to defund. They'll stand behind them. They want the police to protect them. That don't make no sense.",en
../data/audios\6911813210655952134,Question for Trump supporters. Why do you hate women and minorities? Hmm? Okay. I'm not gonna lie I get a little bit excited when I see videos like this and this may be personal to my experience But I have a feeling that it's not so let me tell you why these videos make me a little bit happy Let me start by saying it takes a little seed of doubt to change a whole person's perspective so when I was a liberal and I was working for the left I Was inundated with this message that the right hates black people the right hates women They wish you were dead. So I harbored that message. I marinated on it I went out into the world and I didn't experience any of that. Boom. There's the seed. So I'm thinking Where are all these racist Republicans I keep hearing about and surprise surprise I couldn't find any so I started to research and we all know that's how liberals become conservatives So you can call me Johnny Appleseed I'll be planting seeds of doubt till the day I die because Trump supporters do not hate women and they do not hate minorities you,en
